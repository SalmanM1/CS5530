# Report for Visualizations 1-5 
## V1 
The side-by-side boxplots compare math and reading distributions within each gender. For females, the median reading score sits above the median math score, and the interquartile range for reading is slightly tighter, which shows more consistency in reading. For males, math and reading medians are closer, with math typically a bit higher than reading. Both genders show several low outliers (more visible in math), suggesting a small subset of students who struggle substantially. The top performers cap near 100 for both subjects, so there are no high outliers. Overall, females tend to lead in reading, males are slightly stronger in math, and the distributions still overlap heavily, so differences are very minor on average.
## V2 
The bar chart shows a higher mean math score for students who completed the test-preparation course compared with those who did not. The difference is about 5–6 points (~69.7 vs ~64.1). This gap is large enough to be educationally meaningful even though the figure does not display variability. The result is associational, not causal as students who complete test prep may also differ in motivation, prior achievement, or support. Still, from a practical standpoint, the chart supports the idea that test preparation participation correlates with better math performance on average. We should definitely look into this more deeper if we want to separate preparation from confounding factors.
## V3 
For visualization 3 I made two visualizations because the instruction confused me a little bit. For the first visualization, each student’s overall average is the mean of their math, reading, and writing scores. We then compare those averages by lunch type. Students with standard lunch average about 70.8, while free/reduced students average about 62.2, a difference of roughly 8–9 points. Because lunch status often displays family resources, this gap is consistent with socioeconomic patterns in achievement. Although this plot shows only means, the magnitude of the gap suggests a systematic difference rather than random chance. Taken together, the result implies that resource access may matter across subjects, not just in one area. Breaking the analysis down by subject shows the same pattern across math, reading, and writing. In the standard group, means cluster around 70–72 across subjects; in the free/reduced group, means are lower—about 58.9 in math and low-to-mid 60s in reading (~64.7) and writing (~63.0). Reading and writing are a bit higher than math in both groups, consistent with the strong reading writing link seen in the next correlation heatmap. The fact that the gap appears in all three subjects shows a broader academic difference instead of a single subject issue. The subject level view also clarifies where the gap is largest (math) and where it is narrower (reading/writing).
## V4 
The heatmap shows strong positive correlations among the three subjects: reading–writing ~ 0.95, math–reading ~ 0.82, and math–writing ~ 0.80. Reading and writing are most tightly coupled, which is expected because both rely on overlapping language skills. Math is also strongly related to the language subjects, implying that study skills, background knowledge, and general academic proficiency is relevant across all subjects. Because all three are highly correlated, gains in one subject like reading will perpetrate gains in others. This shows that literacy rich environments and cross disciplinary practice can have large benefits. The strength of these coefficients also helps explain why overall averages move together across groups like with the lunch types visualization.
## V5
The scatter plot shows a clear positive association between reading and math. Students with higher reading scores tend to score higher in math. The best-fit lines for the completed and no test preparation groups have similar slopes, showing a comparable math and reading relationship in both groups. However, the completed group’s points sit slightly higher overall, suggesting a higher intercept at the same reading score, their math score is a bit higher on average. The legend confirms large sample sizes, so the trend is not driven by tiny groups. This pattern reinforces our interpretation of visualization 2 that  test preparation participation aligns with slightly stronger math outcomes, even after accounting for reading level. The figure highlights the tight math reading link and the small lift associated with completing test prep.
